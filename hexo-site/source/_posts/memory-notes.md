计算机内存是处理器数据的存储仓库

## 内存基础知识
1. trade-off: price, capacity, performance 
   - if we fix price, then capacity and performance is zero-sum 
   - performance: latency, bandwidth, parallelism, $bandwidth = parallelism/latency$

2. multi-level memory system: because of the trade-off of memory, if we want both performance and capacity, we must use multi-level memory:
   - cache: small but fast
   - main memory: big bug slow
   - disk: large and very slow
   -
